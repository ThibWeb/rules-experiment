rules-experiment
================

An experiment around simple business rules written in JavaScript for non-technical people.

## Goals

Offer the simplest syntax possible to create simple expressions. Thus,

- Expressions must always evaluate to either true or false.
- Expressions are composed of logical and mathematical operators.
- Expression's syntax should be as terse as possible.

## Trying it out

Either with node (`node index.js`) or in the browser console (open `index.html`).
